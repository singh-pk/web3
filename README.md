# About the project

The UI of this project is made using React and TypeScript.

Blockchain implementations for a particular protocal can be seen in their respective folders. For example, if you want to see all projects that are build on Solana, just navigate to [solana](https://github.com/singh-pk/web3/tree/main/solana).

> This project is under continuous development and I will keep on pushing new projects every now and then. If you want any help troubleshooting, feel free to DM me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/pksn). If you have a better/alternative solution, please open a PR.
